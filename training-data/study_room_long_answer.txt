You can book an individual or group study room here: https://mypc.solent.ac.uk/MyPC/BookingGrid.htm
You can use the study rooms without booking in advance but be aware they might be booked by someone else. You will only be able to use them until the next booking starts. Check the computer screen to see how long a room is available for and log-in to secure the room for as long as possible.
Each booking can be up to 4 hours long. When your booking is coming to an end, you may extend the booking by 1 hour at a time, provided the room is available.
