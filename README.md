## Brief

The recent growth and developments in AI (Artificial Intelligence) have revolutionised the way we live. Applications of AI are increasing day by day. Some of the mind-boggling applications include other fascinating applications include medical diagnostics, face recognition, speech recognition and synthesis, robotics, self-driving cars, chatbots, language translation, and many more.

This assignment asks to identify a real-world problem which can potentially be solved by apply AI techniques. You would design and implement a working prototype by applying appropriate AI methods to solve the identified problem. You should be able to demonstrate your prototype. You will consider legal, social, ethical, and professional issues as appropriate and relevant to your project.

You are required to build a working prototype for the following:

- Automatic chatbot tool (Automated responders and online customer support) A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. You need to propose and develop an approach for an automatic chatbot tool.

You will be expected to demonstrate your working prototype and the session will be arranged by your tutor. You will also be required to send your source code along with the instruction to run the prototype. Your technical report structure could have the following sections although you need to add more subsections; Introduction, Statement of the problem, Aims and Objectives, Proposed Solution along with the justification, Prototype Development & AI Algorithms, Limitation and Conclusion. Your submission should consist of the following:

- Your technical report (Word or PDF)
- Your source code with instructions on how to run the prototype

You will be working in groups (typically 4 to 5 students per group but it could be flexible to accommodate your personal preference) for the implementation of the prototype. However, the report needs to be written individually.
